      <h1>Project Name: Study Room Website</h1>
      <h3>Full-Stack Study Room Website using REACT and Django.</h3>
      <p>This is a communications website that lets the user share text chat with other users of the study rooms.
        The structure of the website is that there are certain topics created by the admin and then any user can
        create a room on one or more than one of those topics and he/she gets to be the host of that study room
        where people interested in that topic can join the room to chat by posting questions and answers and
        share their ideas and improve their knowledge by clearing their doubts in that topic. A complete user
        authentication system is implemented to register and login into the website.</p>
